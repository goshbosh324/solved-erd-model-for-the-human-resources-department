Use Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Visio<sup>®</sup> to <strong>create</strong> an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) model for the Human Resources Department tables in the business case when Human Resources data have to be merged into centralized master database from different departments.

The ERD model should <strong>illustrate</strong> the data quality process you would recommend for the Master Data Management (MDM) system you described in the business case stated above.

<strong>Identify</strong> the MDM requirements in your ERD model and ensure that you address risk and security.

<strong>Include</strong> the following in your ERD model:

<ul>

 <li>Fact tables, dimension tables, relationships, and cardinality</li>

 <li>MDM concepts that impact your design</li>

</ul>

<strong>Provide</strong> an explanation for each element contained within the ERD and the data quality process you would recommend for the MDM system.
